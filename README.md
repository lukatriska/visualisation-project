Visualising the US border crossing data 

For now, this is a very early draft of the project. Here are the tasks to be implemented in the next couple of days:

* [X] how the crossing data and numbers have changed from 1996 to 2019
* [ ] how the flow of people from Canada and from Mexico correlate, and how it has changed during those years
* [X] the correlation between the people/vehicle ratio in different border crossing places, and how much gas could be saved if they all traveled by 20+ people buses, approximately how much co2 was emitted 
* [ ] if the above is not enough for the project :), I would try to forecast how many people\vehicles cross certain ports in the future, this could help to make the ports bigger where they need to be, and make sure no queues appear

        Now, let's try to visualise the people/vehicle ratio in different border crossing places, and how much gas could
        be saved if they all traveled by 20 people buses, approximately how much co2 was emitted. Note: approximately
        1.5 people travel in a personal vehicle on average

        If we assume that on average, a vehicle had to travel 150km to cross the border, and an average personal vehicle
        fuel consumption was 10l/100km, and a bus that carries 20 people consumes 13l of fuel/100km, than we can calculate
        how much litres of fuel would not be burned, if all the personal vehicle passengers travelled by
        20 people buses.
